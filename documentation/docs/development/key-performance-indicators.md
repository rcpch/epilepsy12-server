The Key Performance Indicators are listed [here]('../clinician-users/clinician-user-guide.md##Audit Dataset')

the ```KPI``` model stores these indicators as individual fields, together with the help and reference text that is signposted in the template.

Each query for each KPI is stored in a separate file within the `/common_view_functions/calculate_kpi_functions/` folder. The comment text at the head of each function documents the parameters of each query, the numerator and denominator.

## Scoring

Key performance indicators have 4 states:

- Failed (0)
- Passed (1)
- Ineligible (2)
- Unscored (None)

An example of an ineligible KPI would be a child with nonconvulsive epilepsy not needing an ECG.

This scoring system allows a child's individual score to be displayed clearly in the template using colours or icons to reflect their adherence to different measures, or for the scores to be aggregated together, for example to show how a give organisation performs against its peers in the same or another region. The results can be tabulated or mapped to show geographical variation, and sequentially against cohort to change over time.

The KPIs are final endpoint of the audit and therefore their accuracy is essential. A full suite of [tests](./testing/testing.md) is in place to ensure this is true.

Note that the KPIs are only calculated for the **currently submitting** cohort *that have completed a full year of care*

The KPIs are aggregated to generate totals and percentages as well as averages across different levels of abstraction - by this is meant, either at organisational level, trust/health board level, or NHS region etc.

They are key part of the [reporting](reporting.md) dashboard.

To simplify the development environment setup and provide greater consistency between development and production environments, the application is built as a Docker image and Docker Compose sets up the other necessary containers in development.

This means you don't need to worry about conflicts of Python versions, Python library versions, or Python virtual environments. Everything is specified and isolated inside the Docker containers.

## Setup for development using Docker Compose

### Install Docker on your development machine

Instructions for all platforms are at [:fontawesome-brands-docker: get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

### Clone the Audit Engine repository to your code folder

```console
git clone https://github.com/rcpch/rcpch-audit-engine.git
```

### Navigate into the folder

```console
cd rcpch-audit-engine
```

!!! warning "Windows Setup"
    **If you are on Windows**, after installing Docker and cloning the repository, please now skip to the [(Windows) Setup for development using Docker Compose](./docker-setup-windows.md) section.

### Ensure you are on the default `development` branch

```console
git checkout development
```

### Obtain a `.env` file containing the required environment files

These files contain credentials and secrets and therefore the `.env` files themselves are **never** committed to version control. All `*.env` files are `.gitignore`'d, as is the entire contents of the `envs/` folder except the env_template file.

If you work with the RCPCH Incubator team, another member of the team may be able to supply you with a completed `.env` file.

For anyone else, there is a template environment file in the repository root which you can rename to `.env` and use as a starting point. **Be extremely careful to make sure it is named `.env` so that it is ignored by Git. Do not ever commit `.env` files to version control!**

```console
cp envs/env-template envs/.env
```

!!! warning "Mac Users"
    If using Mac and Safari, to access the Epilepsy 12 engine in your development, you must change the `SITE_DOMAIN` name in .env to 'localhost', and type this into your browser once you have executed `s/up` in the next step. This will load the E12 engine in your Safari browser.
    However, for simplicity, we recommend using a different browser, such as Chrome, and leaving the .env file unaltered.

### Start the development environment for the first time using our startup script

```console
s/up
```

This script automates all the setup steps including upgrading `pip`, installing all development dependencies with `pip install`, migrating the database and seeding the database with some essential data.

### Trust the Caddy root CA certificate

To get a HTTPS connection through the Caddy server to work on `e12.localhost`, you need to trust the Caddy root CA certificate. This is only necessary once. We have a script to automate this.

```console
s/trust-caddy-root-ca
```

If you encounter problems, further instructions for this are in the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running#local-https-with-docker). With some browsers you may need to manually add the certificate in the Security settings, see the above link for details. Restart the browser after trusting the certificate.

### Startup

`s/up` will build the necessary Docker images, create the containers, and start them up. There will be a lot of output in the terminal, but it should create a number of containers and network them together. If you hit errors, please do open an issue.

At the very end of the terminal output, which could take several minutes, you should see something like this:

```console
rcpch-audit-engine-web-1          | Django version 4.2.5, using settings 'rcpch-audit-engine.settings'
rcpch-audit-engine-web-1          | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
rcpch-audit-engine-web-1          | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

!!! warning "<https://e12.localhost>, not <http://localhost:8000>"
    **IMPORTANT: Because we are using the Caddy web server as a reverse proxy, the application should be accessed at <https://e12.localhost>, not <http://localhost:8000>, even though Django will still report that is the hostname and port it 'thinks' it is listening on.**

Changes you make in your development folder are **automatically synced to inside the Docker container**, and will show up in the application right away, as long as your .env file is configured with `DJANGO_STARTUP_COMMAND="python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"`. (We have other startup commands we use in production environments which don't have auto-reload)

Please do open an issue if there is anything that doesn't seem to work properly. Suggestions and feature requests welcome.

### What does `s/up` do?

This script automates all the setup steps including:

- upgrading `pip`
- installing all development dependencies with `pip install`
- migrating the database
- seeding the database

The `django` container is built with the correct Python version, all development dependencies are automatically installed, the database connection is created, migrations applied and some seed data is added to the database.

View the application in a browser at <e12.localhost>.

Changes you make in your development folder are automatically synced to inside the Docker container, and will show up in the application right away.

This Docker setup is quite new so please do open an issue if there is anything that doesn't seem to work properly. Suggestions and feature requests welcome.

!!! warning "Terminal is now occupied"
    If you have successfully run the Docker Compose deployment, your terminal will be showing the combined and colour-coded logging output for all the containers and will no longer show an interactive prompt, which is means you can not run any more commands in that terminal. To resolve this, simply **open another Terminal window** in the same working directory, in which you can run commands.
    If opening another terminal is impractical or impossible, then in most Shell environments you can press `Ctrl`+`Z` to suspend the current process, and then `bg` to resume it in the background. This will return you to an interactive prompt. Once you've executed your further commands, you can then use `fg` to bring the console logging output back to the foreground again.

### Creating a superuser

You can use our convenience script to create a superuser in the context of the `django` container.

```console
s/create-superuser
```

The script will prompt you for required user attributes:

```console
Email address: myexampleemail@example.com
Role: 1
First name: Test
Surname: User
Is rcpch audit team member: True
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

#### Notes on superuser creation:

- `Role` - this is an enum which comes from `epilepsy12.constants.user_types.ROLES` and is an integer between 1 and 5
- `Is rcpch audit team member` - this is a boolean value, either `True` or `False`
- `Password` - for superusers in local development it is possible to bypass the minimum password strength requirements, but this is not possible in production environments.

### Executing commands in the context of the `django` container

You can run arbitrary commands in the context of any of the containers using Docker Compose.

The below command will execute `<command>` inside the `django` container.

```console
docker compose exec django <command>
```

For example, to send a test email

```console
sudo docker compose exec django python manage.py sendtestemail myexampleemail@example.com
```

### Running the test suite

```console
s/test
```

This will execute our suite of Pytest tests inside the `django` container, and the output should be displayed in the console for you.

### Shutting down the Docker Compose environment

++ctrl+c++ will shut down the containers but will leave them built. This means you can restart them rapidly with `s/up`.

To shut down all containers use

```console
s/down
```

To shut down **and destroy the containers and the images** they are built from, use

```console
s/down-rm-containers-images
```

To go even further and **delete all the data of the application**, including the database, use

```console
s/DELETE-LOCAL-DATA
```

For obvious reasons this is something that should **ONLY** be done in local development environments and never on Live! It is named with a different pattern to all the other scripts in order to prevent it accidentally being run.

### Restarting and rebuilding the containers

For convenience and speed we have created some scripts to restart and rebuild the containers.

```console
s/restart
```

is the equivalent of running `s/down` followed by `s/up`.

```console
s/rebuild
```

is the equivalent of running `s/down-rm-containers-images` followed by `s/up`.

### Seeding with dummy data

For testing of the UI it is often useful to have some dummy data in the database. We have a script to seed the database with some dummy data.

```console
s/seed
```

See the [Seeding the Database](manual-setup.md#seeding-the-database) section for more details on the usage of this script, for example setting a non-default Cohort Number.

## Tips and Tricks, Gotchas and Caveats

### Reconnecting to containers which are already running

If you run `docker ps` and it lists the full suite of running E12 containers, and you just want to reconnect to the scrolling log output in the current terminal window, you can just type `s/up` which will not restart anything if they are already running, it will just reconnect to the outputs of those containers so you can see the logs.

### Even with Docker, there are a few external local dependencies

Although the Docker Compose setup is very convenient, and it installs all the runtime development dependencies _inside_ the `django` container, one thing it can't do is install any _local_ Python packages which are required for code editing, linting, and similar utilities _outside_ the container. Examples are `pylint`, `pylint_django`, etc. You will still need to install these locally, ideally in a virtual environment using `pyenv`. The versions of these dependencies are much less likely to conflict across projects, so you could probably get away with installing them in your system Python if you wished.

### Docker Compose and Virtual Private Networks

If you experience persistent problems with Docker's internal connectivity, make sure you are not using a system-wide Virtual Private Network, or some other tool which might block Docker's internal network traffic. We experienced this problem using **Mullvad** VPN on Linux Mint, on one of our developer team's machines. Docker compose ran fine, and each container appeared to work independently, but each container was unable to 'see' the others, resulting in crashes and errors. The solution was to disable the VPN.

### Docker build cache errors on VPS deployments

On some occasions we have encountered errors when trying to run `s/up` on a VPS, where the Docker build cache is corrupted. This can be resolved by running `docker builder prune` and then `s/up` again. This clears the Docker build cache and forces it to rebuild the images from scratch. Importantly for Live, it does not affect Docker Volumes, so the database and other data is not lost.

title: Dropdowns and Lists

The classification of epilepsy is multiaxial and current practice advocates describing a patient's epilepsy using the DESSCRIBE model. This has been built into Epilepsy12 in the Multiaxial Diagnosis tab.

## Episodes

This recognises that a child's epilepsy is often made up of different episodes, some of which are witnessed, others not, and each may have different semiology, so documenting as many as possible helps the clinician build a picture that can lead them ultimately to make a diagnosis. E12 seeks to capture as much of this and seeks to gain further information an knowledge in semiology - how to describe a seizure. In the description, users are encouraged to describe the events of a seizure in their own words and the platform will compare these against a validated list (from the International League against Epilepsy) from 2017. In this process it is hoped through text analysis that a larger list of key words can be built to improve on what is currently published.

## Syndromes

This comprises a list:

## Epilepsy Causes

Where possible these are maintained using the SNOMED-CT classification system. Epilepsy is a fast-moving science and causes are identified faster than SNOMED can update, so E12 maintains its own list of causes, associating them where possible with the SNOMED-CT identifier and preferred term. Currently this list includes:

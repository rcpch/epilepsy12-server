## Getting Started

### Making a new account

Lead Clinicians from Trusts/Health Boards will need to contact the Epilepsy12 team to create their account.

Clinicians and Administrators can ask their Lead to create an account for them. Alternatively, they can contact the Epilepsy12 team, who can create their account with written permission from the relevant Trust/Health Board Lead Clinician.

If you are a lead, you can make new accounts by navigating to the `Staff View`, selecting the relevant organisation, and clicking the ‘Add new user’ button.

If your Trust/Health Board does not have a lead registered to the audit already, you will need select a Lead clinician and we will require approval from the Trust/Health Board’s Caldicott Guardian. This is to ensure that we are only providing trusted individuals with access to the Epilepsy12 platform and the data hosted within the system.

When your account is created, you’ll be emailed a link to set your password. This link expires after **72 hours**. If your link has expired, please contact the Epilepsy12 team to send you a new link.

### Logging in

Click the ‘Sign in’ button on the home page to log in.

The first time you log in, you will need to set up 2 factor authentication. This is an additional security measure to prevent unauthorised access to patient data. You will have the choice to either set up an email token or an authenticator app.

#### Email token

If you select email token, you will receive a six digit code to your inbox. You will need to enter that code to log in.

#### Authenticator app

If you select authenticator app, you will need to download the Microsoft Authenticator app on a smartphone or tablet.
Once you have downloaded and logged into the app, you will need to follow the instructions provided to set up the authenticator app.

Each time you log in, you will need to access your authenticator app and enter your one-time password to log in. This password will be a six digit code that resets every 30 seconds.

If you lose access to your authenticator app, please contact the Epilepsy12 team.

### Reset password
If you have forgotten your password, click ‘Reset Password’ and a link to create a new password will be sent to your email address, and this will remain active for 72 hours.

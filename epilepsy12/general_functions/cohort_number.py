    * Returns the cohort number as an `int` from the first paediatric assessment date as a Python `datetime.date`

    * Dates which are too early to return a valid cohort number will return `None`. Ensure to test for a `None` return value before doing anything with the result.

    * Cohort Number is used to identify the groups in the audit by year.

    * Cohorts are defined between 1st December year and 30th November in the subsequent year. Note, the final submission date
    is the second Tuesday in January after the closing date 1 YEAR ON. So if the cohort closes on 30 Nov 22, the submission date is
    the second Tuesday after 30/11/23, which is 9 Jan 24

    * Time zone is not explicity supplied. Since this is a UK audit, time zone is assumed always to be UK.

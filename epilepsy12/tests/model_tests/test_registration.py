    In the process the existing site sets the `site_is_actively_involved_in_epilepsy_care` to False and a new site is create where it is set it to True.
    If the new site is already involved in epilepsy care, the `site_is_primary_centre_of_epilepsy_care` is set to True, and the existing responsibility is retained.
    The old site is retained in the database, but is no longer the primary site of care.

    the `transfer_response` method is called from the view when the new site approves the transfer request.
    It accepts the Organisation id of the new organisation, the case id and a string indicating the response of the new organisation.
    This string can be either 'accept' or 'reject'.

    This test is set up to test if the new site rejects the transfer request, if the new site is not already involved in the epilepsy care.

    Tests that the `transfer_response` method works as expected.

    This method is used to transfer the primary site of care to a new site.
    In the process the existing site sets the `site_is_actively_involved_in_epilepsy_care` to False and a new site is create where it is set it to True.
    If the new site is already involved in epilepsy care, the `site_is_primary_centre_of_epilepsy_care` is set to True, and the existing responsibility is retained.
    The old site is retained in the database, but is no longer the primary site of care.

    the `transfer_response` method is called from the view when the new site approves the transfer request.
    It accepts the Organisation id of the new organisation, the case id and a string indicating the response of the new organisation.
    This string can be either 'accept' or 'reject'.

    This test is set up to test if the new site rejects the transfer request, if the new site is not already involved in the epilepsy care.
